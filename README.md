## Applied Data Science Capstone
This is my Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. I analyzed 
data from several sources in order to determine if a Startup could enter in the business of
commercial space travel. From Data Collection to Machine Learning prediction for predicting the 
sucess of every single launch, I go through Data Wrangling, EDA and Interactive Dashboards to
make a inverse engineering study as Data Scientist.
